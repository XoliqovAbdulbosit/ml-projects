# Classical Machine Learning Portfolio

## 📖 Overview
This repository contains a collection of end-to-end Machine Learning projects demonstrating proficiency in **Supervised** and **Unsupervised Learning**. 

The objective is to simulate real-world data science workflows: moving from raw data cleaning and complex feature engineering to model optimization and business insight generation.

## 📂 Projects

| Project | Type | Key Techniques | Objective |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Fraud Detection](ml/supervised-learning/Classifying_Fraud_Transactions.ipynb)** | Classification | **XGBoost, SMOTE**, Cost-Sensitive Learning | Detect fraudulent transactions in a highly imbalanced dataset using Precision/Recall optimization. |
| **[Customer Spend Prediction](ml/supervised-learning/Predicting_Customer_Spend_RFM_Regression.ipynb)** | Regression | **RFM Analysis**, Feature Engineering, Visualizations | Predict future customer spending (LTV) based on historical purchasing behavior. |
| **[Customer Segmentation](ml/unsupervised-learning/retail-customer-segmentation.ipynb)** | Unsupervised | **PCA, K-Means**, Anomaly Detection | Segment customers into marketing personas and identify purchasing anomalies. |
